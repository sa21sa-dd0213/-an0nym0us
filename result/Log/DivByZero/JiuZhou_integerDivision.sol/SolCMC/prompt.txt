### Role  
You are a blockchain security expert specializing in analyzing vulnerabilities in smart contracts using formal verification.  

### Source Program  
Below is the source code of a Solidity program that has been proven to be vulnerable:  
pragma solidity ^0.8.2;

contract getWageNumber {
    uint256 public coefficient;
    uint256 public DailyWage;
    address public boss;

    constructor() public{
        DailyWage = 100;
        coefficient = 3;
        boss = msg.sender;
    }

    function setDailyWage(uint256 _wage) external {
		require(msg.sender == boss);
        DailyWage = _wage;
    }

    function setCoefficient(uint256 _co) external {
		require(msg.sender == boss);
        coefficient = _co;
    }

    function calculateWage(uint256 dayNumber) external view returns (uint256) {
        require(msg.sender == boss);
		uint256 baseWage = DailyWage / coefficient;
        return baseWage * dayNumber;
    }
}

### Counterexample  
The verifier SolCMC identified a division-by-zero in this program and generated a counterexample detailing the state changes, transaction sequence, violated property, and location of the final violation state:  

Division by zero happens here.
Counterexample:
coefficient = 0, DailyWage = 100, boss = 0x0
dayNumber = 0
baseWage = 0

Transaction trace:
getWageNumber.constructor(){ msg.sender: 0x0 }
State: coefficient = 3, DailyWage = 100, boss = 0x0
getWageNumber.setCoefficient(0){ msg.sender: 0x0 }
State: coefficient = 0, DailyWage = 100, boss = 0x0
getWageNumber.calculateWage(0){ msg.sender: 0x0 }
  --> origin.sol:27:22:
   |
27 |            uint256 baseWage = DailyWage / coefficient;
   |                               ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

### Vulnerability Context
The violated property, division-by-zero, occurs when a contract attempts to divide a number by zero, resulting in a runtime exception and contract execution failure. A common approach to trigger a division-by-zero is to pass zero as a divisor in a function that performs division.

### Background  
Real-world vulnerabilities often involve multiple interactions rather than a single self-contained function call. The reproduction contract should reflect this by structuring the exploit as a series of interactions instead of executing it immediately.  

### Task  
Generate a **realistic** reproduction smart contract named `Reproduction` that interacts with the vulnerable contract to re-trigger the identified vulnerability. If the vulnerable contract calls an external contract through an interface, `Reproduction` **must inherit from that interface** and implement all required functions.  

### Requirements  
- **Utilize the counterexample and vulnerability context:**  
  - Extract key function calls, transaction sequence, and final violation conditions.  
  - Structure the exploit accordingly, ensuring it includes all necessary elements to trigger the issue.  
- **Maintain Solidity compatibility:** The reproduction contract must match the Solidity version of the source contract and be compilable alongside it.  
- **Decomposed contract structure:**  
    - Use an interface-separated (Interaction-Separated)  pattern, where sequential interactions are needed rather than a single function that fully encapsulates the exploit.  Implement separate functions for setup, triggering the vulnerability, and interacting with the vulnerable contract.  
- **Strict output format:** Output only Solidity code. Do not include explanations, comments, or justifications.

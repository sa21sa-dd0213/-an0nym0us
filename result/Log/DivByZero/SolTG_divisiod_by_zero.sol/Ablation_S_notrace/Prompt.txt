Below is the source code of a Solidity program that has been proven to be vulnerable: 
pragma solidity ^0.8.2;

contract C {
    function div(uint256 a, uint256 b) public returns (uint256) {
        return a / b;
    }

    function mod(uint256 a, uint256 b) public returns (uint256) {
        return a % b;
    }
}

Your task is to generate a reproduction smart contract that can re-trigger the vulnerability by interacting with the source program via a series of function calls.
Generate the reproduction contract without any comments.

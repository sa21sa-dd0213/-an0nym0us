Below is the source code of a Solidity program that has been proven to be vulnerable: 

// SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-3.0
pragma solidity >=0.7.0 <0.9.0;
contract Base {
    int8 public x = 2;
    function div_zero() private view
    {
        int y = 10/(x-2);
    }
}

Your task is to generate a reproduction smart contract that can re-trigger the vulnerability by interacting with the source program via a series of function calls.
Generate the reproduction contract without any comments.

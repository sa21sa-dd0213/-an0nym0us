Below is the source code of a Solidity program that has been proven to be vulnerable: 
pragma solidity ^0.8.2;

contract C {
	function f(uint x, uint y) public pure returns (uint) {
		return x % y;
	}
}

Your task is to generate a reproduction smart contract that can re-trigger the vulnerability by interacting with the source program via a series of function calls.
Generate the reproduction contract without any comments.

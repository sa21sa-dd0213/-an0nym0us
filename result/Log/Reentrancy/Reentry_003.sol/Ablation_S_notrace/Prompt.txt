Below is the source code of a Solidity program that has been proven to be vulnerable: 
//https://github.com/fsainas/contracts-verification-benchmark/blob/main/contracts/bank/
//SPDX-License-Identifier: UNLICENSED
pragma solidity >= 0.8.2;

/// @custom:version conformant to specification
contract Bank {
    mapping (address => uint) balances;

    function deposit() public payable {
        balances[msg.sender] += msg.value;
    }

    function withdraw(uint amount) public {
        /// @custom:preghost function withdraw
        uint old_user_balance = address(msg.sender).balance;
        require(amount > 0);
        require(amount <= balances[msg.sender]);

        (bool success,) = msg.sender.call{value: amount}("");
        balances[msg.sender] -= amount;
        require(success);
        /// @custom:postghost function withdraw
        uint new_user_balance = address(msg.sender).balance;
        assert(new_user_balance == old_user_balance + amount);
}
}

Your task is to generate a reproduction smart contract that can re-trigger the vulnerability by interacting with the source program via a series of function calls.
Generate the reproduction contract without any comments.

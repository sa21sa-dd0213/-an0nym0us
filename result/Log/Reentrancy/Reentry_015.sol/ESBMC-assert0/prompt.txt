### Counterexample  
The verifier ESBMC identified a reentrancy in this program and generated a counterexample detailing the state changes, transaction sequence, violated property, and location of the final violation state:  

[Counterexample]

State 7 file origin.sol line 219 function invariant thread 0
----------------------------------------------------
Violated property:
  file origin.sol line 219 function invariant
  assertion
  ___sent <= initial_deposit

VERIFICATION FAILED

Bug found (k = 1)

### Vulnerability Context
The violated property, reentrancy, occurs when a contract makes an external call before updating its state, allowing an attacker to repeatedly enter the contract and manipulate execution. A common approach to trigger reentrancy is to call a function that interacts with an external contract that re-calls the vulnerable function before the first execution completes. This is typically achieved using a payable fallback function, which allows the attacker contract to receive funds and immediately reenter the vulnerable contract before the original execution is finalized.

### Background  
Real-world vulnerabilities often involve multiple interactions rather than a single self-contained function call. The reproduction contract should reflect this by structuring the exploit as a series of interactions instead of executing it immediately.  

### Task  
Generate a **realistic** reproduction smart contract named `Reproduction` that interacts with the vulnerable contract to re-trigger the identified vulnerability. If the vulnerable contract calls an external contract through an interface, `Reproduction` **must inherit from that interface** and implement all required functions.  

### Requirements  
- **Utilize the counterexample and vulnerability context:**  
  - Extract key function calls, transaction sequence, and final violation conditions.  
  - Structure the exploit accordingly, ensuring it includes all necessary elements to trigger the issue.  
- **Maintain Solidity compatibility:** The reproduction contract must match the Solidity version of the source contract and be compilable alongside it.  
- **Decomposed contract structure:**  
    - Use an interface-separated (Interaction-Separated)  pattern, where sequential interactions are needed rather than a single function that fully encapsulates the exploit.  Implement separate functions for setup, triggering the vulnerability, and interacting with the vulnerable contract.  
- **Strict output format:** Output only Solidity code. Do not include explanations, comments, or justifications.

Below is the source code of a Solidity program that has been proven to be vulnerable: 
//https://github.com/fsainas/contracts-verification-benchmark/blob/main/contracts/bank/
//SPDX-License-Identifier: UNLICENSED
pragma solidity >= 0.8.2;

/// @custom:version conformant to specification
contract Bank {
    mapping (address => uint) balances;

    function deposit() public payable {
        balances[msg.sender] += msg.value;
    }

    function withdraw(uint amount) public {
        require(amount > 0);
        require(amount <= balances[msg.sender]);

        (bool success,) = msg.sender.call{value: amount}("");
        balances[msg.sender] -= amount;
        require(success);
    }
    function invariant(uint choice, uint u1, address a) public payable {
        uint currb = balances[a];
        if (choice == 0) {
            deposit();
        } else if (choice == 1) {
            withdraw(u1);
        } else {
            require(false);
        }
        uint newb = balances[a];

        require(newb < currb);
        assert(choice == 1);
        assert(msg.sender == a);
}
}

Your task is to generate a reproduction smart contract that can re-trigger the vulnerability by interacting with the source program via a series of function calls.
Generate the reproduction contract without any comments.

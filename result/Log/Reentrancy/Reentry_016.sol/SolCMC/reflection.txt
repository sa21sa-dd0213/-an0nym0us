The generated reproduction contract failed to re-trigger the identified vulnerability.

**Issue Diagnosis:**
- **Incorrect Function Inputs or State Setup:**  
   The expected bug did not trigger, meaning the original property **remained valid** instead of being violated. To verify this, the property was negated and enforced as an invariant. The verifier produced the following execution trace:  
Assertion violation happens here.
  --> origin.sol:37:9:
   |
37 |         assert(false);
   |         ^^^^^^^^^^^^^

   This confirms that the vulnerable code location was reached and that the reversal property was violated. However, the expected bug did not trigger. This suggests that while the overall structure is correct, the function inputs or initial state conditions may be incorrect.

**Refinement Direction:**
- Keep the overall contract structure (function signatures, inheritance, state variables) unchanged. Refine the input parameters or state setup to match the expected bug-triggering conditions (as indicated by the counterexample).

**Task:**
Based on the feedback above, refine the reproduction contract to ensure that:
- It initiates calls from the reproduction contract only (i.e., no external accounts trigger the bug directly).
- - It maintains the correct function call sequence while adjusting inputs and state conditions.
- It sets the appropriate inputs and state conditions required to trigger the vulnerability.

Return an improved reproduction contract (Solidity code only) that addresses the identified issues.

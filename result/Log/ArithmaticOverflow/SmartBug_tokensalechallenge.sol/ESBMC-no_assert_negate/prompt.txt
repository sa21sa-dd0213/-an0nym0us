### Role  
You are a blockchain security expert specializing in analyzing vulnerabilities in smart contracts using formal verification.  

### Source Program  
Below is the source code of a Solidity program that has been proven to be vulnerable:  
pragma solidity ^0.8.19;

contract TokenSaleChallenge {
    mapping(address => uint256) public balanceOf;
    uint256 constant PRICE_PER_TOKEN = 1 ether;

    constructor() public payable {
        require(msg.value == 1 ether);
    }

    function isComplete() public view returns (bool) {
        return address(this).balance < 1 ether;
    }

    function buy(uint256 numTokens) public payable {

        require(msg.value == numTokens * PRICE_PER_TOKEN);

        balanceOf[msg.sender] += numTokens;
    }

    function sell(uint256 numTokens) public {
        require(balanceOf[msg.sender] >= numTokens);

        balanceOf[msg.sender] -= numTokens;

        payable(msg.sender).transfer(numTokens * PRICE_PER_TOKEN);
    }
}

### Counterexample  
The verifier ESBMC identified a arithmetic overflow in this program and generated a counterexample detailing the state changes, transaction sequence, violated property, and location of the final violation state:  
[Counterexample]

State 66 file origin.sol line 12 function buy thread 0
----------------------------------------------------
Violated property:
  file origin.sol line 12 function buy
  arithmetic overflow on add
  !overflow("+", this->balanceOf[(signed long int)return_value$__address$1], numTokens)

VERIFICATION FAILED

Bug found (k = 2)

### Vulnerability Context
The violated property, arithmetic overflow, occurs when a value exceeds the maximum limit for a data type, causing it to wrap around to a small value. A common approach to trigger an overflow is to add or multiply values that exceed the type's limit.

### Background  
Real-world vulnerabilities often involve multiple interactions rather than a single self-contained function call. The reproduction contract should reflect this by structuring the exploit as a series of interactions instead of executing it immediately.  

### Task  
Generate a **realistic** reproduction smart contract named `Reproduction` that interacts with the vulnerable contract to re-trigger the identified vulnerability. If the vulnerable contract calls an external contract through an interface, `Reproduction` **must inherit from that interface** and implement all required functions.  

### Requirements  
- **Utilize the counterexample and vulnerability context:**  
  - Extract key function calls, transaction sequence, and final violation conditions.  
  - Structure the exploit accordingly, ensuring it includes all necessary elements to trigger the issue.  
- **Maintain Solidity compatibility:** The reproduction contract must match the Solidity version of the source contract and be compilable alongside it.  
- **Decomposed contract structure:**  
    - Use an interface-separated (Interaction-Separated)  pattern, where sequential interactions are needed rather than a single function that fully encapsulates the exploit.  Implement separate functions for setup, triggering the vulnerability, and interacting with the vulnerable contract.  
- **Strict output format:** Output only Solidity code. Do not include explanations, comments, or justifications.

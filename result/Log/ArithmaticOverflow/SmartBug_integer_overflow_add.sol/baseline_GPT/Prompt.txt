Below is the source code of a Solidity program that has been proven to be vulnerable: 
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract IntegerOverflowAdd {
    uint public count = 1;

    function run(uint256 input) public {
        // <yes> <report> ARITHMETIC
        count += input;
    }
}

Your task is to generate a reproduction smart contract that can re-trigger the vulnerability by interacting with the source program via a series of function calls.
Generate the reproduction contract without any comments.

Below is the source code of a Solidity program that has been proven to be vulnerable: 
pragma solidity >=0.6.0;

contract _MAIN_ {
    constructor () public {
        uint8 a = 255;
        uint8 b = 255;

        uint8 c = a + b;

        assert(c == 254);
        assert(c == a + b);
        assert(c > 255);

    }
}

Your task is to generate a reproduction smart contract that can re-trigger the vulnerability by interacting with the source program via a series of function calls.
Generate the reproduction contract without any comments.

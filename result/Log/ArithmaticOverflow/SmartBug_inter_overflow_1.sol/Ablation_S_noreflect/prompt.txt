### Role  
You are a blockchain security expert specializing in analyzing vulnerabilities in smart contracts using formal verification.  

### Source Program 
Below is the source code of a Solidity program that has been proven to be vulnerable:   
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract Overflow {
    uint private sellerBalance = 0;

    function add(uint value) public returns (bool) {
        sellerBalance += value;
        return true;
    }
}

### Counterexample  
The verifier SolCMC identified a arithmetic overflow in this program and generated a counterexample detailing the state changes, transaction sequence, violated property, and location of the final violation state:  
Overflow (resulting value larger than 2**256 - 1) happens here.
Counterexample:
sellerBalance = 1
value = 115792089237316195423570985008687907853269984665640564039457584007913129639935
 = false

Transaction trace:
Overflow.constructor()
State: sellerBalance = 0
Overflow.add(1)
State: sellerBalance = 1
Overflow.add(115792089237316195423570985008687907853269984665640564039457584007913129639935)
  --> origin.sol:13:9:
   |
13 |         sellerBalance += value;
   |  

### Vulnerability Context
The violated property, arithmetic overflow, occurs when a value exceeds the maximum limit for a data type, causing it to wrap around to a small value. A common approach to trigger an overflow is to add or multiply values that exceed the type's limit.

### Background  
Real-world vulnerabilities often involve multiple interactions rather than a single self-contained function call. The reproduction contract should reflect this by structuring the exploit as a series of interactions instead of executing it immediately.  

### Task  
Generate a **realistic** reproduction smart contract named `Reproduction` that interacts with the vulnerable contract to re-trigger the identified vulnerability. If the vulnerable contract calls an external contract through an interface, `Reproduction` **must inherit from that interface** and implement all required functions.  

### Requirements  
- **Utilize the counterexample and vulnerability context:**  
  - Extract key function calls, transaction sequence, and final violation conditions.  
  - Structure the exploit accordingly, ensuring it includes all necessary elements to trigger the issue.  
- **Maintain Solidity compatibility:** The reproduction contract must match the Solidity version of the source contract and be compilable alongside it.  
- **Decomposed contract structure:**  
    - Use an interface-separated (Interaction-Separated)  pattern, where sequential interactions are needed rather than a single function that fully encapsulates the exploit.  Implement separate functions for setup, triggering the vulnerability, and interacting with the vulnerable contract.  
- **Strict output format:** Output only Solidity code. Do not include explanations, comments, or justifications.

### Role  
You are a blockchain security expert specializing in analyzing vulnerabilities in smart contracts using formal verification.  

### Source Program  
pragma solidity ^0.8.11;

contract C
{
	function f(uint8 x) public pure returns (uint8) {
		x = 100;
		uint8 y = x * 3;
		assert(y == 44);
		x = 128;
		y = x * 4;
		assert(y == 0);
		return y;
	}
}

### Counterexample  
The verifier SolCMC identified a arithmetic overflow in this program and generated a counterexample detailing the state changes, transaction sequence, violated property, and location of the final violation state:  
Overflow (resulting value larger than 255) happens here.
Counterexample:

x = 100
 = 0
y = 0

Transaction trace:
C.constructor()
C.f(0)
 --> origin.sol:7:13:
  |
7 |             uint8 y = x * 3;
  |                       ^^^^^

Overflow (resulting value larger than 255) check is safe!
  --> origin.sol:10:7:
   |
10 |            y = x * 4;
   |                ^^^^^

### Vulnerability Context
The violated property, arithmetic overflow, occurs when a value exceeds the maximum limit for a data type, causing it to wrap around to a small value. A common approach to trigger an overflow is to add or multiply values that exceed the type's limit.

### Background  
Real-world vulnerabilities often involve multiple interactions rather than a single self-contained function call. The reproduction contract should reflect this by structuring the exploit as a series of interactions instead of executing it immediately.  

### Task  
Generate a **realistic** reproduction smart contract named `Reproduction` that interacts with the vulnerable contract to re-trigger the identified vulnerability. If the vulnerable contract calls an external contract through an interface, `Reproduction` **must inherit from that interface** and implement all required functions.  

### Requirements  
- **Utilize the counterexample and vulnerability context:**  
  - Extract key function calls, transaction sequence, and final violation conditions.  
  - Structure the exploit accordingly, ensuring it includes all necessary elements to trigger the issue.  
- **Maintain Solidity compatibility:** The reproduction contract must match the Solidity version of the source contract and be compilable alongside it.  
- **Decomposed contract structure:**  
    - Use an interface-separated (Interaction-Separated)  pattern, where sequential interactions are needed rather than a single function that fully encapsulates the exploit.  Implement separate functions for setup, triggering the vulnerability, and interacting with the vulnerable contract.  
- **Strict output format:** Output only Solidity code. Do not include explanations, comments, or justifications.

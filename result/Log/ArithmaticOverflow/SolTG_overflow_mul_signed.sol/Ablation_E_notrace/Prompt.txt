Below is the source code of a Solidity program that has been proven to be vulnerable: 
pragma solidity ^0.8.11;

contract C
{
	function f(int8 x) public pure returns (int8) {
		x = 100;
		int8 y;
		y = x * 2;
		assert(y == -56);
		y = x * 100;
		assert(y == 16);
		return y;
	}
}

Your task is to generate a reproduction smart contract that can re-trigger the vulnerability by interacting with the source program via a series of function calls.
Generate the reproduction contract without any comments.

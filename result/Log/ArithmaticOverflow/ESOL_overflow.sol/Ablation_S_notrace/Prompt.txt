Below is the source code of a Solidity program that has been proven to be vulnerable: 
// SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-3.0
pragma solidity >=0.4.26;

contract MyContract {
    uint8 _x;
    uint8 _y;
    uint8 sum;

    function func_overflow() external {
      _x = 100;
      _y = 240;
      sum = _x + _y;
      assert(sum > 100);
    }
}

Your task is to generate a reproduction smart contract that can re-trigger the vulnerability by interacting with the source program via a series of function calls.
Generate the reproduction contract without any comments.

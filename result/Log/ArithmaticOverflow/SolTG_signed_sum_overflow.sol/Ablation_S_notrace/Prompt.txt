Below is the source code of a Solidity program that has been proven to be vulnerable: 
pragma solidity ^0.8.11;

contract C  {
	function f(int x, int y) public pure returns (int) {
		return x + y;
	}
}

Your task is to generate a reproduction smart contract that can re-trigger the vulnerability by interacting with the source program via a series of function calls.
Generate the reproduction contract without any comments.

Below is the source code of a Solidity program that has been proven to be vulnerable: 
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract IntegerOverflowAdd {
    mapping (address => uint256) public balanceOf;

    // INSECURE
    function transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) public{
        /* Check if sender has balance */
        require(balanceOf[msg.sender] >= _value);
        balanceOf[msg.sender] -= _value;
        // <yes> <report> ARITHMETIC
        balanceOf[_to] += _value;
}

}

Your task is to generate a reproduction smart contract that can re-trigger the vulnerability by interacting with the source program via a series of function calls.
Generate the reproduction contract without any comments.

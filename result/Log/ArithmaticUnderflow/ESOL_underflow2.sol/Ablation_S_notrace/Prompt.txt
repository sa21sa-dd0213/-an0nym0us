Below is the source code of a Solidity program that has been proven to be vulnerable: 
// SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-3.0
pragma solidity >=0.4.26;

contract MyContract {
    uint8 x;

    function func_underflow() external {
      x = 1;
      --x;
      --x;
      assert(x < 5);
    }
}

Your task is to generate a reproduction smart contract that can re-trigger the vulnerability by interacting with the source program via a series of function calls.
Generate the reproduction contract without any comments.

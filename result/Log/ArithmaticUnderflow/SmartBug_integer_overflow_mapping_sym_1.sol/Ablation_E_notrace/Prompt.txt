Below is the source code of a Solidity program that has been proven to be vulnerable: 
pragma solidity ^0.8.19;

contract IntegerOverflowMappingSym1 {
    mapping(uint256 => uint256) map;

    function init(uint256 k, uint256 v) public {

        map[k] -= v;
    }
}Your task is to generate a reproduction smart contract that can re-trigger the vulnerability by interacting with the source program via a series of function calls.
Generate the reproduction contract without any comments.

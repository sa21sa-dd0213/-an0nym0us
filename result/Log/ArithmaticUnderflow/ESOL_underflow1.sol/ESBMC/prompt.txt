### Role  
You are a blockchain security expert specializing in analyzing vulnerabilities in smart contracts using formal verification.  

### Source Program  
Below is the source code of a Solidity program that has been proven to be vulnerable:  
// SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-3.0
pragma solidity >=0.4.26;

contract MyContract {
    uint8 x;

    function func_loop() external {
      x = 2;
      for (uint8 i=0; i<3; ++i) {
        --x;
        assert(x < 5);
      }
    }
}

### Counterexample  
The verifier ESBMC identified a arithmetic underflow in this program and generated a counterexample detailing the state changes, transaction sequence, violated property, and location of the final violation state:  
[Counterexample]

State 15 file origin.sol line 8 function func_loop thread 0
----------------------------------------------------
  this->x = 2 (00000010)

State 17 file origin.sol line 10 function func_loop thread 0
----------------------------------------------------
  this->x = 1 (00000001)

State 21 file origin.sol line 10 function func_loop thread 0
----------------------------------------------------
  this->x = 0 (00000000)

State 24 file origin.sol line 10 function func_loop thread 0
----------------------------------------------------
Violated property:
  file origin.sol line 10 function func_loop
  arithmetic overflow on sub
  !overflow("-", this->x, 1)

VERIFICATION FAILED

Bug found (k = 3)

### Vulnerability Context
The violated property, arithmetic underflow, occurs when a value goes below the minimum limit for a data type, causing it to wrap around to a large value. A common approach to trigger an underflow is to subtract a value larger than the stored value.

### Background  
Real-world vulnerabilities often involve multiple interactions rather than a single self-contained function call. The reproduction contract should reflect this by structuring the exploit as a series of interactions instead of executing it immediately.  

### Task  
Generate a **realistic** reproduction smart contract named `Reproduction` that interacts with the vulnerable contract to re-trigger the identified vulnerability. If the vulnerable contract calls an external contract through an interface, `Reproduction` **must inherit from that interface** and implement all required functions.  

### Requirements  
- **Utilize the counterexample and vulnerability context:**  
  - Extract key function calls, transaction sequence, and final violation conditions.  
  - Structure the exploit accordingly, ensuring it includes all necessary elements to trigger the issue.  
- **Maintain Solidity compatibility:** The reproduction contract must match the Solidity version of the source contract and be compilable alongside it.  
- **Decomposed contract structure:**  
    - Use an interface-separated (Interaction-Separated)  pattern, where sequential interactions are needed rather than a single function that fully encapsulates the exploit.  Implement separate functions for setup, triggering the vulnerability, and interacting with the vulnerable contract.  
- **Strict output format:** Output only Solidity code. Do not include explanations, comments, or justifications.

Below is the source code of a Solidity program that has been proven to be vulnerable: 

pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract MyContract {
  uint8 i;
  function dyn_array_oob_loop(uint8 n) public {
    uint8[] memory a = new uint8[](n);
    for (i = 0; i < n; ++i){
      a[i] = 100;
    }
    assert(a[0] == 100);
  }
}

Your task is to generate a reproduction smart contract that can re-trigger the vulnerability by interacting with the source program via a series of function calls.
Generate the reproduction contract without any comments.

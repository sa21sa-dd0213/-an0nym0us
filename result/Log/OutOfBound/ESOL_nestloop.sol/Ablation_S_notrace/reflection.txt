The reproduction contract failed to compile with the source contract.
Error: Identifier already declared.

13 | contract Base {
   | ^ (Relevant source part starts here and spans across multiple lines).

### **Issue Diagnosis & Fix:**
Use the error message to identify and fix the issue:
0. **Avoid Duplicating Existing Entities**
   - Do not include entities (contracts, interfaces, libraries, etc.) from the original program in the generated reproduction contract.
   - Generate the `Reproduction` contract only, no other entities, no `import` statement.

1. **Function Signature Mismatch:**  
   - Ensure functions interacting with the source contract **match exact signatures**.  
   - If implementing an interface, **fully implement required functions**.

2. **Type Mismatch:**  
   - Ensure function parameters, return types, and storage variables **match expectations**.  

3. **Inheritance & Interface Errors:**  
   - Ensure correct inheritance and **implement all required functions** from parent contracts/interfaces.  

4. **Visibility & Access Control Issues:**  
   - Match function visibility (`public`, `private`, etc.) with the source contract.  

5. **Solidity Version Mismatch:**  
   - Ensure `pragma solidity` **matches the source contract's version**.  

### **Task:**  
Fix compilation issues while keeping the exploit logic **unchanged**. Return only the revised Solidity contract.

The generated reproduction contract failed to re-trigger the identified vulnerability.

**Issue Diagnosis:**
- **Incorrect Function Inputs or State Setup:**  
   The expected bug did not trigger, meaning the original property **remained valid** instead of being violated. To verify this, the property was negated and enforced as an invariant. The verifier produced the following execution trace:

   This confirms that the vulnerable code location was reached and that the reversal property was violated. However, the expected bug did not trigger. This suggests that while the overall structure is correct, the function inputs or initial state conditions may be incorrect.

**Refinement Direction:**
- Keep the overall contract structure (function signatures, inheritance, state variables) unchanged. Refine the input parameters or state setup to match the expected bug-triggering conditions (as indicated by the counterexample).

**Task:**
Based on the feedback above, refine the reproduction contract to ensure that:
- It initiates calls from the reproduction contract only (i.e., no external accounts trigger the bug directly).
- - It maintains the correct function call sequence while adjusting inputs and state conditions.
- It sets the appropriate inputs and state conditions required to trigger the vulnerability.

Return an improved reproduction contract (Solidity code only) that addresses the identified issues.

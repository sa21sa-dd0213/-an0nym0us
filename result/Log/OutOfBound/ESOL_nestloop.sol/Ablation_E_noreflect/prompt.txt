### Role  
You are a blockchain security expert specializing in analyzing vulnerabilities in smart contracts using formal verification.  

### Source Program  
Below is the source code of a Solidity program that has been proven to be vulnerable:  
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract Base {
    uint[] public a;

    function SelectionSort(uint array_size) public {
        uint i;
        uint j;
        uint min;
        uint temp;
        for (i = 0; i < array_size - 1; ++i) {
            min = i;
            for (j = i + 1; j < array_size; ++j) {
                if (a[j] < a[min]) min = j;
            }
            temp = a[i];
            a[i] = a[min];
            a[min] = temp;
        }
    }
}

### Counterexample  
The verifier ESBMC identified a array out-of-bounds in this program and generated a counterexample detailing the state changes, transaction sequence, violated property, and location of the final violation state:  
[Counterexample]

State 13  thread 0
----------------------------------------------------
  _ESBMC_Object_Base = { .a = 0 }

State 18  thread 0
----------------------------------------------------
Violated property:
  dereference failure: NULL pointer

VERIFICATION FAILED

Bug found (k = 1)

### Vulnerability Context
The violated property, array out-of-bounds, occurs when an array index accessed is equal to or greater than the arrayâ€™s length, leading to a contract crash. A common approach to trigger an array out-of-bounds error is to pass an invalid index value to an array access function.

### Background  
Real-world vulnerabilities often involve multiple interactions rather than a single self-contained function call. The reproduction contract should reflect this by structuring the exploit as a series of interactions instead of executing it immediately.  

### Task  
Generate a **realistic** reproduction smart contract named `Reproduction` that interacts with the vulnerable contract to re-trigger the identified vulnerability. If the vulnerable contract calls an external contract through an interface, `Reproduction` **must inherit from that interface** and implement all required functions.  

### Requirements  
- **Utilize the counterexample and vulnerability context:**  
  - Extract key function calls, transaction sequence, and final violation conditions.  
  - Structure the exploit accordingly, ensuring it includes all necessary elements to trigger the issue.  
- **Maintain Solidity compatibility:** The reproduction contract must match the Solidity version of the source contract and be compilable alongside it.  
- **Decomposed contract structure:**  
    - Use an interface-separated (Interaction-Separated)  pattern, where sequential interactions are needed rather than a single function that fully encapsulates the exploit.  Implement separate functions for setup, triggering the vulnerability, and interacting with the vulnerable contract.  
- **Strict output format:** Output only Solidity code. Do not include explanations, comments, or justifications.

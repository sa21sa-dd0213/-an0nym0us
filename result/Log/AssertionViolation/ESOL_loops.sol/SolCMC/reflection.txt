The reproduction contract failed to compile with the source contract.

### **Error Message:**
Error: Wrong argument count for function call: 0 arguments given but expected 1.

### **Issue Diagnosis & Fix:**
Use the error message to identify and fix the issue:
0. **Avoid Duplicating Existing Entities**
   - Do not include entities (contracts, interfaces, libraries, etc.) from the original program in the generated reproduction contract.
   - Generate the `Reproduction` contract only, no other entities, no `import` statement.

1. **Function Signature Mismatch:**  
   - Ensure functions interacting with the source contract **match exact signatures**.  
   - If implementing an interface, **fully implement required functions**.

2. **Type Mismatch:**  
   - Ensure function parameters, return types, and storage variables **match expectations**.  

3. **Inheritance & Interface Errors:**  
   - Ensure correct inheritance and **implement all required functions** from parent contracts/interfaces.  

4. **Visibility & Access Control Issues:**  
   - Match function visibility (`public`, `private`, etc.) with the source contract.  

5. **Solidity Version Mismatch:**  
   - Ensure `pragma solidity` **matches the source contract's version**.  

### **Task:**  
Fix compilation issues while keeping the exploit logic **unchanged**. Return only the revised Solidity contract.

The generated reproduction contract failed to re-trigger the identified vulnerability.

**Issue Diagnosis:**
- **Unreachable Vulnerability Location:**
   The vulnerable code was never reached. This indicates that the current reproduction contract's function call sequence is incorrectâ€”it does not lead to the intended bug location.

**Refinement Direction:**
- The reproduction contract must be revised to adjust the function call sequence so that the execution reaches the vulnerable code. Redesign the interaction logic to ensure that the bug-triggering function is invoked.
- Simplification. Avoid adding statement (e.g. `require`) that is irrelevant to the reproduction.

**Task:**
Based on the feedback above, refine the reproduction contract to ensure that:
- It initiates calls from the reproduction contract only (i.e., no external accounts trigger the bug directly).
- It follows the correct function call sequence to reach the vulnerable code.
- It sets the appropriate inputs and state conditions required to trigger the vulnerability.

Return an improved reproduction contract (Solidity code only) that addresses the identified issues.

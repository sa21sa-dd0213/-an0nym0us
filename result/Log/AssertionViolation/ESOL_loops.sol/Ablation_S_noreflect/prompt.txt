### Role  
You are a blockchain security expert specializing in analyzing vulnerabilities in smart contracts using formal verification.  

### Source Program  
Below is the source code of a Solidity program that has been proven to be vulnerable:  
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract Loop1{

  uint sum = 0;
  uint number = 0;
  uint a = 0;

  function multiply() public {

    for(uint i = 0; i<a; i++){
      sum = sum+number;
    }
    assert (sum < 25);

  }

  function enter(uint x) public {
    number = 5;
    if (a < x){
      a = a+1;
    }   
  }

}

### Counterexample  
The verifier SolCMC identified a assertion violation in this program and generated a counterexample detailing the state changes, transaction sequence, violated property, and location of the final violation state:  
Assertion violation might happen here.
  --> origin.sol:14:5:
   |
14 |     assert (sum < 25);
   |     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

### Vulnerability Context
The violated property, assertion violation, occurs when an assert statement fails, causing the contract to revert due to an unexpected condition. A common approach to trigger an assertion violation is to provide inputs that force the contract into an invalid state where an assert(condition) fails.

### Background  
Real-world vulnerabilities often involve multiple interactions rather than a single self-contained function call. The reproduction contract should reflect this by structuring the exploit as a series of interactions instead of executing it immediately.  

### Task  
Generate a **realistic** reproduction smart contract named `Reproduction` that interacts with the vulnerable contract to re-trigger the identified vulnerability. If the vulnerable contract calls an external contract through an interface, `Reproduction` **must inherit from that interface** and implement all required functions.  

### Requirements  
- **Utilize the counterexample and vulnerability context:**  
  - Extract key function calls, transaction sequence, and final violation conditions.  
  - Structure the exploit accordingly, ensuring it includes all necessary elements to trigger the issue.  
- **Maintain Solidity compatibility:** The reproduction contract must match the Solidity version of the source contract and be compilable alongside it.  
- **Decomposed contract structure:**  
    - Use an interface-separated (Interaction-Separated)  pattern, where sequential interactions are needed rather than a single function that fully encapsulates the exploit.  Implement separate functions for setup, triggering the vulnerability, and interacting with the vulnerable contract.  
- **Strict output format:** Output only Solidity code. Do not include explanations, comments, or justifications.

Below is the source code of a Solidity program that has been proven to be vulnerable: 
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

pragma solidity ^0.8.11;

contract Bank {
    uint public a;
    uint public b;

    constructor () public {
        a = 3;
        b = 0;
    }
}

contract _MAIN_ {
    Bank bank;

    constructor () public {
        bank = new Bank();
        uint a = 0;
        a = bank.a();

        assert(a == 3);
        assert(a == 4);
    }
}

Your task is to generate a reproduction smart contract that can re-trigger the vulnerability by interacting with the source program via a series of function calls.
Generate the reproduction contract without any comments.

The generated reproduction contract failed to re-trigger the identified vulnerability.

**Issue Diagnosis:**
- **Unreachable Vulnerability Location:**
   The vulnerable code was never reached. This indicates that the current reproduction contract's function call sequence is incorrect—it does not lead to the intended bug location.

**Refinement Direction:**
- The reproduction contract must be revised to adjust the function call sequence so that the execution reaches the vulnerable code. Redesign the interaction logic to ensure that the bug-triggering function is invoked.
- Simplification. Avoid adding statement (e.g. `require`) that is irrelevant to the reproduction.

**Task:**
Based on the feedback above, refine the reproduction contract to ensure that:
- It initiates calls from the reproduction contract only (i.e., no external accounts trigger the bug directly).
- It follows the correct function call sequence to reach the vulnerable code.
- It sets the appropriate inputs and state conditions required to trigger the vulnerability.

Return an improved reproduction contract (Solidity code only) that addresses the identified issues.

### **Issue Diagnosis & Fix:**
Use the error message to identify and fix the issue:
0. **Avoid Duplicating Existing Entities**
   - Do not include entities (contracts, interfaces, libraries, etc.) from the original program in the generated reproduction contract.
   - Generate the `Reproduction` contract only, no other entities, no `import` statement.

1. **Function Signature Mismatch:**  
   - Ensure functions interacting with the source contract **match exact signatures**.  
   - If implementing an interface, **fully implement required functions**.

2. **Type Mismatch:**  
   - Ensure function parameters, return types, and storage variables **match expectations**.  

3. **Inheritance & Interface Errors:**  
   - Ensure correct inheritance and **implement all required functions** from parent contracts/interfaces.  

4. **Visibility & Access Control Issues:**  
   - Match function visibility (public, private, etc.) with the source contract.  

5. **Solidity Version Mismatch:**  
   - Ensure pragma solidity **matches the source contract's version**.  

### **Task:**  
Fix compilation issues while keeping the exploit logic **unchanged**. Return only the revised Solidity contract.

Below is the source code of a Solidity program that has been proven to be vulnerable: 
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract Csma {
	uint x;

	function f() public {
		if (x == 0)
			x = 1;
	}

	function g() public {
		if (x == 1)
			x = 2;
	}

	function h() public {
		if (x < 7)
			x = x+1;
	}

	function j() public {
		if (x == 7)
			x = 100;
	}

	function i() public view {
		assert(x < 9);
	}
}

Your task is to generate a reproduction smart contract that can re-trigger the vulnerability by interacting with the source program via a series of function calls.
Generate the reproduction contract without any comments.

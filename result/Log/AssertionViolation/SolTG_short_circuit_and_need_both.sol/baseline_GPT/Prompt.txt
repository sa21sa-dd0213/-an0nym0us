Below is the source code of a Solidity program that has been proven to be vulnerable: 
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract cs4 {
	uint x;
	function f() public  {
		x = x + 1;
	}
	function g() public  {
		assert(x <= 2);

	}
}

Your task is to generate a reproduction smart contract that can re-trigger the vulnerability by interacting with the source program via a series of function calls.
Generate the reproduction contract without any comments.

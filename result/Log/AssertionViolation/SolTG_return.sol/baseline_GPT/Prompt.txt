Below is the source code of a Solidity program that has been proven to be vulnerable: 
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract Cr1 {
    uint public x;
	function add(uint y) public  {
		if (y == 0)

		if (y == 1)
			++x;
		if (y == 2)
			x = x + 2;
	}

	function f() public {
        assert(x < 2);

	}
}

Your task is to generate a reproduction smart contract that can re-trigger the vulnerability by interacting with the source program via a series of function calls.
Generate the reproduction contract without any comments.

Below is the source code of a Solidity program that has been proven to be vulnerable: 
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract Loop1{

  uint r;
  function mini(uint n) public{
     r = 0;

    while(n>0){
      r = r+1;
      n = n-1;
    }

  }

  function enter() public {
    uint x = 5;
    assert (x == r);
  }

}

Your task is to generate a reproduction smart contract that can re-trigger the vulnerability by interacting with the source program via a series of function calls.
Generate the reproduction contract without any comments.
